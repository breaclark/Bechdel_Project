# Bechdel Test Decision Tree Classifier

### By Brea Clark

This project aims to build on data that can be found at https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/bechdel. It's purpose is to try to predict the verdict of the Bechdel Test based on other factors including genre, age rating, cast, director, etc.

The best way to check out this data is to open Project_Paper.ipynb as a python notebook. Otherwise, you can run the code in the Code folder. First charts, then acquiring_data, then prepping_analyzing_data.
